# Angular4 TODO Webapp:**

This is a simple todo-webapplication I built to get to know angular a bit better. The Scaffold of this Version was generated via @angular/cli.
There is no real persistence layer, to keep things simple. But the applcation can be easily extended via modifications in the provided storage-service.

The Angular-Application resides in /todo-webapp, please refer to the Readme there for further details.

You can find the html-mockup in /todo-app-mockup
